Ethereum is

a. Neutral (Doesn't detect good or bad actors)
b. Public (Anyone can submit a transaction )
c. Immutable code (Code changes are not possible (upgradability is a workaround))
d. New and evolving technology (Security risks are there)
e. Real money (needed to handle carefully)


An attack can do state changes in one transaction or multiple transactions. Transaction made for this purpose are known as exploits
If vulnerable contract is not accessible in direct manner, user can use custom smart contract to attack the vulnerable contract. This can involve a lot of intermediate smart contracts.
